# pong
A bouncing ball game made for an MCU

I made this game over a weekend in quarantine to keep me entertained. I used the minimal MCU I had available to this fun. A power supply was needed
to prevent the chip's power supply from being overwhelmed.

Parts:
* Adafruit Pro Trinket 5V
* Adafruit RA8875
* Breadboard power supply
* Active buzzer
* Joystick
